# `cmux://settings`

`cmux://settings` is a cmux-owned trusted WebUI. `cmux://configure` remains a
compatibility alias. The URL handler rewrites both hosts to the private
`chrome://cmux-configure` implementation; neither aliases an upstream page.
Its config is installed from Chromium's canonical
`RegisterChromeWebUIConfigs()` pass before profile creation. cmux also
reasserts the idempotent registration immediately before installing its URL
rewrite, so a visible cmux settings URL can never resolve to an unregistered
private host. Chromium's registered Chrome WebUI factory also recognizes that
private host directly, matching the dispatch path used by built-in trusted
pages.

## Implemented vertical slice

- First-run entry points for viewing shortcuts and browser setup.
- An Appearance tab with Automatic, Light, and Dark app-icon modes. Automatic
  follows macOS appearance changes live; the explicit choices persist in the
  app's defaults and update the running Dock icon immediately.
- A default-on rounded-content-frame switch backed by the profile preference.
  It updates every open terminal and browser pane immediately and is
  automatically suppressed in fullscreen. Turning it off removes the frame's
  inset/padding as well as its corner mask and outline.
- Searchable inspection of built-in and custom shortcuts, including exact
  key/condition overlaps and an **Open cmux.json** action.
- Add and edit controls append validated, last-rule-wins preferences to the
  existing `keybindings` array while preserving comments, formatting, and
  unrelated settings. Editing a key also appends the matching removal rule so
  the old binding no longer remains active.
- Pressing `?` outside the terminal and omnibox opens a new web tab directly
  on the Keyboard section, where the current value and pending edit are shown
  together before saving.
- Reads run on a sequenced `MayBlock` task runner, never the UI thread.
- Malformed, unreadable, or oversized (over 1 MiB) files are reported and are
  never overwritten.
- Renderer replies are guarded by handler weak pointers and WebUI JavaScript
  lifecycle checks.
- The page uses a self-only CSP plus Chromium's `chrome://resources` promise
  bridge; it permits no inline script or network content.

The shortcut source of truth is `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json` (or an absolute
`CMUX_CONFIG`), not Web Storage. Shortcut edits update only the top-level
`keybindings` array and use an atomic file replacement, so comments and
unrelated settings remain untouched; malformed, unreadable, and oversized
files are rejected without a write. External edits reload automatically in
every cmux window. App-icon mode is stored in the macOS application defaults;
the rounded-frame option is stored in the Chromium profile. Reload the
settings page itself to refresh its shortcut inspector snapshot.

## Follow-up integration

Default search, browser-data import, and default-browser registration currently
open Chromium's native settings pages and are explicitly labeled **Next
steps**. They still need cmux-native status/results in this page, especially a
per-source import report and partial-failure UI. Sidebar/layout, appearance,
downloads, privacy, and startup behavior still have additional settings to be
bridged. Individual
Advanced editing, including command arguments, remains available directly in
the JSONC file.

The app menu navigates its cmux configuration item to `cmux://settings`.
